    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>Whenever a natural or man-made disaster strikes a country, aid workers rush from around the globe to stop the suffering. Unfortunately, most of them do not speak the language of those they are trying to serve.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, members of the affected community who are geographically removed from the crisis' epicenter are often unable to contribute beyond watching on television and wiring money home.</p>
    <p>Speakeasy provides a local phone number for relief workers to call during emergency situations to receive a real human translator to guide them through the language barrier.</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Speakeasy uses the Twilio internet calling API to connect callers cheaply anywhere in the world. A high-concurrency node.js server handles and routes calls to ensure fast service when it's needed.</p>
